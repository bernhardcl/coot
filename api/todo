    - sequence mismatches ::: 2

    - B-factor this vs average/sd B-factor environment ::: 2

   - make an interface to gaussian surface that allows me to specify the atom selection
     (e.g "all atoms", or "not ligand")  ::: 2

   o Add Bond-by-distance (normal/basic coot bonding)  ::: 4

   B602 ZN is normal atom size in 4puc (so it looks tiny compared to the water atoms) ::: 1

   A check for git server,
   B check how much pyrogen is transferable

Fri  2 Jun 16:02:06 BST 2023

   o function for fix atom at position (and refine for n cycles)

Sat  3 Jun 19:33:43 BST 2023

   o in coot-refinement we have move_single_atom_of_moving_atoms(). That doesn't care if the
     atom has been marked fixed or not!

--- Done Items ---

   o add a status flag to simple_mesh_t - used for "did we run out of memory/bad alloc"? (say) ::: 1
* Done.
