# Primarily for Indian Names.
#
# Say we are given str: (list "M." "D." "Albert" "Dorkins").  We want
# to return ""Albert" not "M.")  We reject names that are one
# character long and names that are 2 characters long that end in
# ".".  So, "M." is rejected, but "Ma" is not.
#
# An excercise for the committed is to also reject run-together
# dotted initials such as "D.K.".  I was sufficiently committed.
# BL says: I'll try to too! Although I dont think this is a valuable
# (Win)Coot function, but fun though...
