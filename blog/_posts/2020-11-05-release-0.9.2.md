This is a bug-fix release, I'd made of a mess of "colour by B-factor" colouring.
This releases fixes most of that.

![Coot B-factor CA-mode]({{"../../../images/ca-b-factor-improvement.png"}})

However, it turned out that not everything was fixed and I've just added yet another
colouring fix (multi-colours for multi-chains).

So expect 0.9.3 for that fix.
