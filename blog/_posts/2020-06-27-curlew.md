The Coot Utility Refinement Library Extension Wrangler (Curlew) is,
the means by which one can easily install extensions.

It exists so that I can create updates/or interface new (scripting)
functionality without you needing to get a new binary installation.

It currently contains tools for Cryo-EM model-building and an improved
(at least in my hands) terminal residue addition algorithm. And many
other possibly/hopefully useful tweaks.
