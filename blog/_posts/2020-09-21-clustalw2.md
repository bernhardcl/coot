title:  "Adding in Clustalw2"

Clustalw2 has now joined the Coot dependencies - that means that we can use it for alignments locally (yay!)
This replaces the need to use MUSCLE on the EBI web server - which causes cut and paste kerfuffle,
and that is entirely non-winning at tutorials.


The command to activatite is:

```lisp
(run-clustalw-alignment imol chain-id target-sequence-pir-file)
```


although I will probably add a gui for it later.

Available in 0.9.1.
