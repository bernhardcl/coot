I have added a means to dynamically change the weights during real
space refinement (as the molten zone/moving atoms are being displayed)

![Dynamic weights dialog]({{"../../../images/dynamic-weights.png"}})

The additional (and now dynamic) comboboxes can be found under "More Control..."
in the Refinement and Regularization Control Dialog.
