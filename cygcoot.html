<h2>How to install CygCoot?</h2>
First install cygwin. Here's what to do and get:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>get cygwin via setup.exe from mirror site (see <a
 href="http://www.cygwin.com">http://www.cygwin.com</a>) which
uses an easy usable gui installer </li>
  <li>from normal mirror (s.a.) you can/have to get (besides the basic
defaults): </li>
  <ul>
    <li>guile and guile-devel </li>
    <li>python (I think comes
with default) </li>
    <li>opengl (IMPORTANT: get opengl-1.1.0-6
(needed for gl headers!!) newer versions won't work!)</li>
    <li>wget </li>
    <li>X11 </li>
    <li>binutils, gcc, g++, make, tcsh, vi
etc. </li>
    <li>libpng12-devel (needed for
imlib) </li>
    <li>Xfree86-lib-compat </li>
    <li>Windowsmaker or similar (recommended but not necessary)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>from the (cyg)gnome master mirror you get all the gnome/gtk
goodies
(http://cygnome.sourceforge.net/install) </li>
  <li>add http://cygnome.sourceforge.net/install in the setup.exe gui
to
your download sites and download:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>GNOME-libs: glib (1.2.10), gnome-libs, gtk+, imlib, gdk-pixbuf
(I usually get some more, just in case)</li>
    <li>GNOME-libs-devel:
gtk+-devel, gtkglarea, imlib-devel, glib-devel (plus as above) </li>
    <li>N.B.
this saves time and hassle installing these things 'by hand' </li>
    <li>N.B. all gnome things
get installed in /opt/gnome - important for compiling issues!!! </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>That should be everything for cygwin! This is all done with the
gui so no
intervention required so far!</li>
  <li>You can start your cygwin console now.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You should add /opt/gnome/bin to your PATH now (if not done
automatically), e.g. insert in your .bash_profile:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"># Set PATH so it includes gnome stuff
bin if it exists<br>
if [ -d /opt/gnome/bin ] ; then<br>
&nbsp; PATH="/opt/gnome/bin:${PATH}"<br>
fi <br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Now we are ready to do the coot etc. installation. I recommend to
use the available <a href="build-it.txt">build-it</a> script. Since it
is (or should) be hassle free and you could spare Paul and me questions
concerning the installation.</li>
  <li>type <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;">sh ./build-it.txt <br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
and go for a coffee (or grow some crystals) since it will take a while.<br>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>That should be hopefully you done with the installation.</li>
  <li>To start CygCoot you need to run the cygwin Xserver. This is done
by typing <span style="font-style: italic;">xinit</span> in your
console. I recommend to use WindowsMaker or similar which you get by
typing <span style="font-style: italic;">xinit wmaker</span> (or put
wmaker in your .xinitrc).</li>
  <li>now tell Coot where to find everything by typing: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">source ~/coot/setup/coot.sh</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
(or put that line in your .login).</li>
  <li>ready to fire!! Type <span style="font-style: italic;">coot</span>
and off you go!<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Which coot version do I get?</h2>
Currently I can provide (a tarball for) <a href="coot-0.0.18.tar.gz">Coot
v.0.0.18</a> for CygCoot! The same version is provided for WinCoot. I
don't think I
can keep up with Paul's speed in releasing new versions, so be patient.
Hopefully soon you won't have to rely on my tarballs any more and can
update your coot directly from Paul's <a
 href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/%7Eemsley/coot/">website</a>. The
CygCoot <a href="build-it.txt">autobuilder</a> script might become
universal at
some point too (working with Paul on it). Currently I have forced the
installation of
certain libraries (gsl, freeglut) which have be installed 'by hand'
although generally I stick to the libraries provided by cygwin
for as much as possible.
<h2>Any known problems?<br>
</h2>
I installed CygCoot sucessfully on Win NT, Win 2000 and XP (aand
previously even Win 98). It should compile through and run without
problems. In case you want to use Win98, cygwin might run out of
processes
(fork) and the computer has to be rebooted before installation can
continue (about 5-10 times for complete installation). I think this is
a
windows problem that it can't manage the processes.
<br>
CygCoot should run fine, although it might crash occasionally
(it shouldn't though). In case it does report bugs to Paul/me/the coot
mailing list.<br>
Currently there is problems with the scripting, <a
 href="#How_does_the_scripting_work">see below</a>.<br>
For the usual FAQs see Paul's <a
 href="http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/%7Eemsley/coot/">page</a>.<br>
<h2>How fast/slow can I expect it to be?</h2>
CygCoot can be slow, especially on older, slower machines.
Processor speed seems to be everything as it runs via cygwin
emulation!!!! This is fixed in WinCoot. Here is some
Windows Coot benchmarks:<br>

<br>
N.B. This some 'standard' setting I use for testing and can be
'speeded' up by customising your setting! Furthermore I can't use the
full openGL acceleration on my computer for WinCoot (Win 2000). So
expect it to be
much faster... (as can be seen already...)<br>
<h2><a name="How_does_the_scripting_work"></a>How does the scripting
work?</h2>
It seems that only python scripting is working (and compiling) under
Windows. Currently there is some general problems with the python
scripting function I believe. This should be sorted soon (Paul?). It is
fixed in WinCoot now.<br>
